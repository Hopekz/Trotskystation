# The Rules
Hi. Thanks a lot for reading these.  The admin team attempts to make the game as enjoyable as possible while staying as hands-off as possible.  It's a difficult balance to both foster a good experience and not be seen as overbearing.  If you have any questions on any of the rules do not hesitate to adminhelp (using F1 in-game) or message a member of staff/leadership on discord.

## Core Rules
These apply to the Github, Discord, and Server.

### 0.0: Donâ€™t be a dick. Don't behave in a manner that goes out of its way to deprive the enjoyment of others. These rules are not an exhaustive list. Rules-lawyering is strongly discouraged. If an admin asks you to knock something off, 'well it's not in the rules' is not an argument. The staff team maintains the right to arbitrarily remove people that are a clear detriment to the community as a whole.

**0.1: Listen to admins.** Everything is subject to admin discretion. If you cannot be contacted, you may be banned and have you explain your part of the story on the forums. Ignoring admin PMs, lying, insulting admins or other players, or showing a general bad attitude will be counted against you and will lead to a ban.

**0.2: Erotic content is forbidden.** As a general rule, anything more sexualized than kissing and hugging is considered erotic. Do not roleplay acts of an erotic nature. Do not write, upload, or distribute pornographic literature, images, etc.

**0.3: Do not metacommunicate or multikey.** You are only allowed to participate on this server on a single BYOND account. Do not try to join with a different account to continue playing. Only use in-game means of communication to discuss in-game events.

**0.4: Do not abuse bugs.** If you see a bug, report it.

**0.5: Do not mix IC (in character) and OOC (out of character) knowledge.** Do not post information related to a round in progress in the OOC chat or anywhere on the Github or Discord. A person reading the OOC chat should not be able to know what's happening in a round, whether anyone is dead, etc. Do not use information your character would have no way of knowing in game. We have a zero-tolerance policy on this. 

**0.6: Do not spam or advertise.**

**0.7: Speak English.** We are primarily an English speaking community. Speaking in languages the admins do not understand in either IC or OOC can be treated as metacommunications. If there are no admins present, you may only speak in English.


## Server Rules
Core Rules still apply on the server.

**1.0: Keep the game fun.** This is the golden rule of the server. The admins have the right and responsibility to let you break the rules in this section when you are doing something fun, and fully enforce them when you are not. Act maliciously at your own peril. If you're worried something you're about to do might result in punishment, press F1 and adminhelp to ask if you can do it.

**1.1: Do not murderbone when not an antagonist.** When non-antag, engage in murder and aggravated assault at your own peril. If admins deem your killings to be unfun, you will be punished.

**1.2: Do not metagame.** Your character does not know everything you do. If you die and return as a new character, act as a new character. Do not use knowledge you learned in previous lives.

**1.3: Do not use OOC terminology, slang, slurs, or "netspeak" IC.**  If helping someone or necessary use LOOC to communicate.  Abusing OOC, LOOC, or discord to insult others or create a toxic environment will result in an OOC/LOOC/discord ban.

**1.4: Use a realistic name.** Human characters should have at least a first and last name. Obscene names or names that are similar in look or pronunciation to obscene phrases are forbidden. Avoid using famous names or names of other fictional characters. Do not include honorifics in your name. Some roles may be exempt from this rule; contact your local admin for more information.

**1.5: Pick roles that you actually intend to play.**  Do not repeatedly commit suicide at roundstart when playing any job with limited slots. Peasants are exempt from this rule.

### Antagonist Rules
Remember that the all rules above still apply when you are an Antagonist.

**1.1.0: Be active.** Do not hide in a closet somewhere for the entire game. If you have to leave the game, adminhelp so we can replace you and keep the game going.

**1.1.1: Don't teamkill when part of a team.** "Lone wolf" antagonists do not need to follow this rule.


## Discord Rules
Core Rules still apply on Discord.

**2.0: Keep discussion where it should be.** Keep your discussion related to the topic of the channel you're talking in. Keep degenerate or otherwise vaguely-NSFW discussion in `#off-topic` and `#memes`.


## Github Rules
Core Rules still apply on Github.

**3.0: Follow the Contribution guide** when contributing code.
